# Useful Trophies

This is a fork off of Khairex's [ValheimMods](https://github.com/Khairex/ValheimMods).

I patched _Useful Trophies_ to be server-safe, removing all configs that enable players on a server to set their own xp modifiers. Also removed "1337" as a skill you could potentially get xp in, because that just looks weird.
